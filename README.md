# Las Ruinas

## Las Ruinas is my first game using Unity.

## Storyboard for Las Ruinas gameplay

- You (as the user) awake in a Lisa Frank-esque dreamscape and are greeted by a helpful local who tells you of the Queen of the land, a once kind-hearted and fair ruler who's changed. Her subjects haven't seen her since her "Nightmare Vacation" and are worried! The local thanks you for being the adventurer who will bring the Queen back. Before sending you on your way, you are given a treasure to present to Queen Rico upon finding her. 

- Las Ruinas is a maze game where you must make your way through 3 different levels to ultimately find Queen Rico and give her the treasure!

## Preliminary Gameplay Instructions

- Use your keyboard keys as well as your mousepad to navigate the world of Las Ruinas.

## The physical controls you plan to wire in for game operations

- I plan on controlling the user with 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D', or something to that affect, not entirely sure what standard laptop gaming controls are at the moment. I also plan on utilizing mousepad controls and clicks.
